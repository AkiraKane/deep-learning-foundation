# Sentiment Network

A lesson composed of a series of mini-projects on building a neural network (from scratch) to classify sentences as positive or negative. It was a bit too long in my opinion (I spent more time on it than any other lesson), but it was worth it, as it solidified many of the concepts that were a bit shaky after project 1.
