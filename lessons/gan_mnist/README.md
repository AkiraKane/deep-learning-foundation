# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

A lesson introducing GANs. GANs have two parts: the generator and the discriminator. The discriminator's goal is, given an input, determine if it is real or fake (generated). The generator's goal is generate inputs (e.g., images) to fool the discriminator into thinking that they are real, without looking at the original inputs. After some training, there is an equilibrium point where the discriminator and generator become so good, that the generator's output matches the input distribution.
