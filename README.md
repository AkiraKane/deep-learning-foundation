# Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Portfolio (nd101)

Personal implementation of projects in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation course (August 2017).

Check out the folders to see the various projects implemented in Python using iPython (Jupyter) notebooks, along with some commentary in the corresponding README.md files.

# Personal Reflection

Check out [my blog post](https://hyperparticle.com/2017/10/04/udacity-deep-learning/) for a detailed summary of my thoughts on this online course.

This is my first time paying for an online course, and I am impressed at how well this Udacity course was organized. The videos were on point and explained concepts at a reasonable pace. What I like about this kind of format is that it allows me to learn at a pace that is comfortable for me (I usually like it _fast_. I completed the six month course in one month). I would definitely recommend Udacity for getting into the industry with their portfolio-driven approach.
