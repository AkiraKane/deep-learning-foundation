# TensorBoard

A lesson on how to use TensorBoard, a local web app that is useful for inspecting and debugging TensorFlow models.

TensorBoard offers a variety of cool features. It was nice to see the built network visually, which can make it easier to see if something isn't working quite right. I also like how TensorBoard updates its output graphs, and you can run through multiple runs to select networks that perform better.
