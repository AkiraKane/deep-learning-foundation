# Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)

A lesson on DCGANs. Like GANs, DCGANs train a two-part network to generate images matching an input distribution. DCGANs are a type of GAN that uses deep convolutional layers instead of fully connected layers to process data, which is useful for image generation. The generator uses transpose convolutional layers to produce a shallow and wide output image, and the discriminator does the opposite, using convolutional layers to produce a deep and narrow representation to output a true/false value.
